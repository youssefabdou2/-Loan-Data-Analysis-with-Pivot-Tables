Based on your detailed explanation, it sounds like your GitHub project involves using pivot tables in spreadsheets (like Google Sheets or Excel) to analyze loan data by segmenting interest rates based on loan grades. Here's a professional `README.md` file tailored for this context:

# 📊 Loan Data Analysis with Pivot Tables

This project demonstrates how to use pivot tables to analyze loan data and investigate potential investment opportunities. Specifically, we explore how **interest rates** vary across different **loan grades** and uncover patterns in **descriptive statistics** like average, standard deviation, and total credit utilized.

---

## 🔍 Overview

Lenders often assess loans based on a **grade system** (A to G), where:

* **Grade A** = lowest risk, lowest interest rate
* **Grade G** = highest risk, highest interest rate

This project uses a spreadsheet to:

* Segment loans by grade
* Analyze average and variability of interest rates
* Investigate total credit utilized per grade

---

## 📁 Files Included

* `loan_data.xlsx`: Raw loan dataset with interest rates, grades, and credit info
* `pivot_analysis_sheet`: A sheet showing how to build pivot tables step-by-step
* `pivot_solution_sheet`: Final version of pivot tables for reference
* `README.md`: Project documentation

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

* Google Sheets / Microsoft Excel
* Pivot Tables
* Basic statistics (Average, Standard Deviation)

---

## 📊 Key Analyses

1. **Interest Rate by Grade**

   * Used pivot table to compute average interest rate across grades
   * Verified increasing trend from Grade A to G

2. **Standard Deviation of Interest Rate**

   * Added interest rate again to pivot table
   * Changed summarization to `Standard Deviation`
   * Observed increasing variability with riskier loans

3. **Total Credit Utilized by Grade**

   * Added `Total Credit Utilized` feature
   * Changed summarization to `Average`
   * Found most lending occurs in higher-quality (A–C) loans

---

## 🔎 Insights

* All Grade G loans had the **same interest rate**, suggesting a possible cap
* The **variability of rates increases** with loan grade risk
* Grade G showed **high total lending amount**, worth investigating further

---

## 📌 How to Reproduce

1. Open the dataset in Excel or Google Sheets
2. Select the full table and insert a **Pivot Table** in a new sheet
3. Set:

   * **Rows**: Grade
   * **Values**: Interest Rate → `Average`, `Standard Deviation`
   * Optional: Add `Total Credit Utilized` → `Average`
4. Format values as needed (Number with 2 decimal places, Currency, etc.)

## 📈 Example Output

| Grade | Avg Interest Rate | Std Dev | Avg Credit Utilized |
| ----- | ----------------- | ------- | ------------------- |
| A     | 7.13%             | 0.85    | \$35,400            |
| B     | 9.37%             | 1.10    | \$42,700            |
| G     | 17.99%            | 0.00    | \$72,000            |
